# Geometric Modern Art in Processing

# GOALS For This Assignment

1. Learn about 2 recognized artists of Modern Art 
2. Code an original drawing based off the works of Piet Mondrian and Frank Lloyd Wright
4. Practice using ALL the functions you know in Processing 
5. Understand draw order 
6. Understand the Processing 2D coordinate systems 
7. Learn rect and line functions


# REQUIREMENTS 
Demonstrates Asymmetry
Utilizes the functions listed in resources
Concentrate on 3 focal colors and black and white
Design in sketchbook first to determine composition and coordinates 


# RESOURCES 

You need to figure out what numbers to plug in to get the desired behaviour: 

1. ellipse(?, ?, ? , ?) ( x, y coordinates, width, height )
2. size(?, ?) (defines your workspace)
3. rect(?, ?, ?, ?);
4. line(?, ?, ?, ?); (x, y coordinates of first point, x, y of second point)
5. strokeWeight(?); (0=almost invisible, 20+=very thick)
6. stroke(r, g, b); ( 0-255, 0-255, 0-255 )
7. fill(r, g, b); 
8. noStroke();
9. noFill();

# GRADING 

You will be graded on your creativity and your EFFORT. 
It took me about an hour and a half to code my Geometric Modern artwork.
